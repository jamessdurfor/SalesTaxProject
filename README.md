# SalesTaxProject
My code works by doing one of two things.

If the user inputs anything other than an uppercase letter N then it will simply spit out the three standard inputs that were provided to us, prase the lists for the cost of items, apply sales and import tax as needed, then show the end results as requested.

If the letter N is given then it will ask for the user to first input a list of items that are being purchased, then it will ask them for a list of costs for those respective items.  Once it has those two lists it will iterate through them, and spit out the lists after applying the sales and import taxes as needed before showing the total sales tax and the grand total cost of all items after taxes are applied.

My assumptions are that any user inputs will be perfectly formatted in the exact same way 
as they are in the examples we are given with no deviations.  

Also I assume there will be no space after the comma in the inputs.

Further broken down...
1 X (Item name) at
Example
1 Book at,1 Cars at,1 Bag of grapes at

Finally I assume all items of the same name will have the same cost, IE in real life multiple books might have different costs, but that's never presented as a possibility in the data presented to us with this project, so I'm not going to address it in my code.
